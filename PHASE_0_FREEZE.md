# Phase 0 Freeze - ℵ - SYSTEMS

As of this commit, Phase 0 of ℵ - SYSTEMS is frozen.

This means:
- No new features are added under Phase 0
- No scope expansion occurs retroactively
- Only clarifications and typo fixes are permitted

All new capability work must proceed under Phase 1.

This freeze protects conceptual integrity and
prevents endless redefinition.
