# ℵ - SYSTEMS - Phase 0 Index

This index defines the complete and frozen state of Phase 0
for ℵ - SYSTEMS.

Phase 0 establishes the conceptual, architectural, and
minimal capability foundations of the project.

No new features or claims are introduced here.

---

## Phase 0 Scope

Phase 0 covers:
- Mission-level autonomy for quantum space systems
- Explicit exclusion of quantum hardware development
- Software-first, simulation-based grounding
- Bounded, explainable decision-making

Phase 0 does not include:
- Hardware implementation
- Performance optimization
- Flight readiness
- Learning-based autonomy

## Phase 0 Subphases

### Phase 0.1 - Concept Lock & Semantic Precision
- Mission statement and scope
- Definitions and terminology
- Non-claims and boundaries
- Critic-proofing
- External-read readiness

### Phase 0.2 - Selective Capability Grounding
- Mission-state model
- Explainable autonomy decisions
- Action gating
- Scenario simulation
- Minimal test harness
- Safety invariants and small spec

### Phase 0.3 - Consolidation & Freeze
- Canonical indexing
- Phase freeze declaration
- Stability signaling

## Phase 0 Status

Phase 0 is complete up to Phase 0.3.

Future work must proceed under Phase 1
or explicitly reopen Phase 0 by decision.
