# Quantum Computing Satellites – Autonomy Context

Quantum computing payloads impose unique mission constraints:

- Sensitivity to vibration and radiation
- Thermal and cryogenic stability requirements
- Limited operational duty cycles

Autonomous onboard software is required to:
- Protect payload integrity
- Optimize mission timelines
- Reduce reliance on ground control

This repository explores software architectures
that make such missions feasible.
