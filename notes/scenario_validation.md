# Scenario Validation - Phase 0.2

Phase 0.2 validates autonomy behavior using a simple scenario:

Nominal -> Constrained -> Degraded -> Safe -> Recover

The objective is to demonstrate:
- deterministic mission-state transitions
- explicit quantum operation gating
- traceable decision reasons

This scenario is simulation-based and does not represent flight behavior.
