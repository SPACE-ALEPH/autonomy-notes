# Non-Claims and Scope Boundaries - ℵ - SYSTEMS

This document explicitly defines what ℵ - SYSTEMS does not claim,
design, or develop during Phase 0 and early Phase 1.

Its purpose is to prevent misinterpretation and overextension.

---

## Quantum Hardware

ℵ - SYSTEMS does not design, fabricate, or operate:
- Quantum processors or qubits
- Cryogenic systems
- Quantum control electronics
- Error-correcting quantum codes

All quantum hardware is treated as an external payload.

---

## Performance Claims

ℵ - SYSTEMS makes no claims regarding:
- Quantum advantage
- Quantum supremacy
- Computational speedups
- Experimental validation of quantum algorithms

Such claims are outside mission-level software scope.

---

## Autonomy Limits

Autonomy developed by ℵ - SYSTEMS does not include:
- Self-modifying mission goals
- Unbounded or emergent decision-making
- Replacement of human authority
- Artificial general intelligence concepts

All autonomy is bounded, deterministic, and rule-based.

---

## Deployment Status

ℵ - SYSTEMS does not claim:
- Flight-qualified software
- On-orbit demonstrations
- Hardware readiness

All work is explicitly research-stage and simulation-based.

---

## Why These Boundaries Exist

These boundaries ensure:
- Technical honesty
- Credibility with experts
- Compatibility with future certification and collaboration
- Clear separation between research, engineering, and deployment

Scope expansion occurs only in later phases.
