# ℵ – SYSTEMS — External Read Guide

This repository documents the Phase 0 research foundations of ℵ – SYSTEMS.

The focus is mission-level software and autonomy for quantum space systems,
including quantum satellites and future space-based quantum computing platforms.

ℵ – SYSTEMS does not develop quantum hardware.
All work is research-stage, simulation-based, and software-first.

---

## What ℵ – SYSTEMS Is

ℵ – SYSTEMS develops:
- Mission autonomy architectures
- Bounded decision-making logic
- System-level definitions for fragile quantum space payloads

The goal is to enable safe and efficient operation of quantum space systems
under extreme environmental and operational constraints.

---

## What ℵ – SYSTEMS Is Not

ℵ – SYSTEMS does not claim:
- Quantum advantage or supremacy
- Flight-ready systems
- Hardware development or validation

Scope expansion occurs only in later phases.
