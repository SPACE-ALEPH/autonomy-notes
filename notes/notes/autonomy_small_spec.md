# Autonomy Small Specification — ℵ – SYSTEMS (Phase 0.2)

This document defines the minimal, non-negotiable requirements
and invariants governing autonomy behavior in ℵ – SYSTEMS.

The purpose is to prevent silent scope drift and unsafe behavior.

---

## Functional Requirements

FR-1  
The system shall evaluate mission state deterministically
based on observable environmental and system indicators.

FR-2  
The system shall explicitly gate quantum operations
based on the evaluated mission state.

FR-3  
The system shall provide traceable reasons for every autonomy decision.

FR-4  
The system shall prohibit quantum operations in DEGRADED and SAFE states.

---

## Safety Invariants (Must Never Be Violated)

INV-1  
Quantum operations shall never be permitted in SAFE state.

INV-2  
Autonomy shall never initiate quantum operations without
explicit permission from the action-gating logic.

INV-3  
Autonomy decisions shall never occur without trace data.

INV-4  
Human-defined mission constraints shall not be overridden.

---

## Non-Goals (Phase 0.2)

NG-1  
No optimization for performance or efficiency.

NG-2  
No learning-based or adaptive decision logic.

NG-3  
No hardware control or payload-level quantum manipulation.

## Phase Scope Note

This specification applies only to Phase 0.2
and will evolve in later phases under explicit review.
