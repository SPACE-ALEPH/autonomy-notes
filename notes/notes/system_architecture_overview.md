# System Architecture Overview — ℵ – SYSTEMS

## Architectural Perspective

ℵ – SYSTEMS approaches quantum space systems from a mission-level
architecture perspective rather than a payload- or hardware-centric one.

The central abstraction is the **autonomy layer**, which mediates between:
- the physical spacecraft and payload
- the external environment
- human-defined mission intent

## High-Level System Layers

A quantum space system can be viewed as four logical layers:

1. Physical Layer  
   Spacecraft bus, payload hardware, sensors, and actuators.

2. Control Layer  
   Low-level control loops, pointing, thermal regulation, and timing.

3. Autonomy Layer  
   Mission-state awareness, decision logic, and rule-based responses.

4. Mission Intent Layer  
   Human-defined goals, constraints, and operational policies.

ℵ – SYSTEMS focuses primarily on the **Autonomy Layer** and its interfaces.

## Role of the Autonomy Layer

The autonomy layer is responsible for:

- Maintaining awareness of system and payload state
- Interpreting environmental and operational constraints
- Selecting appropriate operational modes
- Coordinating transitions between mission states

It does not directly command hardware.
It reasons about *when* and *whether* actions should occur.

## Inputs to Autonomy

Typical inputs include:

- Telemetry from spacecraft subsystems
- Environmental indicators (thermal, radiation, disturbance)
- Payload readiness signals
- Communication availability
- Time and orbital context

These inputs are abstracted into a system state representation
used by autonomy logic.

---

## Outputs from Autonomy

Autonomy produces bounded decisions such as:

- Permit or defer quantum operations
- Transition between predefined mission modes
- Trigger safe or degraded operational states
- Request ground intervention when required

All outputs remain within predefined mission constraints.

## Applicability to Quantum Space Systems

This architecture applies uniformly to:

- Quantum communication and sensing satellites
- Experimental quantum computing payloads in orbit
- Future distributed space–ground quantum systems

The autonomy layer abstracts mission logic away from
payload-specific implementation details.
