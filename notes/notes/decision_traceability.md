# Decision Traceability - ℵ - SYSTEMS

Autonomous decisions in quantum space systems must be
explainable, auditable, and reviewable.

ℵ - SYSTEMS treats explainability as a core design requirement.

## Why Traceability Matters

Quantum payloads are fragile and high-value.
Unexplained autonomous actions are unacceptable in such missions.

Traceability enables:
- Human trust in autonomy
- Post-event analysis
- Certification and review
- Safe escalation to ground operators

## Decision Trace Concept

Every autonomous decision is associated with:
- Observed inputs
- Evaluated constraints
- Selected mission state
- Resulting action

No decision exists without context.
