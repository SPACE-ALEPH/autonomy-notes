# Definitions - Quantum Space Terminology

## Quantum Satellite
A satellite carrying quantum payloads such as quantum communication,
entanglement distribution, sensing, or timing systems.

These systems are payload-centric and already demonstrate
operational fragility requiring advanced autonomy.

## Quantum Computer in Space
An experimental or future space-based platform hosting
quantum processing capabilities, potentially as part of a
distributed space–ground quantum computing system.

This term does not imply large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers.
It refers to constrained, specialized quantum processing units
operating under extreme environmental and operational limits.

## Quantum Space System
A general term encompassing both quantum satellites and
space-based quantum computing platforms, unified by their
mission-level constraints and reliance on autonomy.
