# Autonomy and Quantum Operations

Quantum operations differ from classical payload operations in that
they are often valid only under tightly constrained conditions.

Examples include:
- Thermal stability within narrow margins
- Low vibration and disturbance environments
- Precise timing and synchronization

Autonomous mission software enables a space system to:
- Evaluate whether conditions are suitable for quantum operations
- Defer execution when conditions are unsafe
- Resume or reschedule operations opportunistically

This capability is essential for both quantum satellites and
future space-based quantum computing platforms.
